Leeds castle walk Kent
Leisure walk not that demanding quite easy only took a while because we were following a guided route which wasn’t always clear.
Managed to reset the form after working at it for a day, found a video clip that explained it and I’m glad it worked. I went for a gentle jog and did a few exercises when I got back. Met up with Precious and the twins after Habiba dropped me of at Pizza hut. Came home

Woke up pre 6, and didn’t check my phone until I was heading out. Read quite a bit of my growth mindset book and also completed the New earth Book the night before. I will need to read it again at some point really good. I logged on to work to catch up on last week as I was behind. Went to site and spent most of the day on the network came back and looked at my code for nearly an hour there was an inner joy in me when I realised that Joy comes from within and so does happiness. This week I really want to be productive and for me that looks as follows:

Go to bed between 9-10:30pm wake up between 5-6:30am.
This mentally gives me a boost to say yes I am ready to seize the day. I don’t want this to be a one off thing but I want to live my life taking control.

Having clear objectives during the day so the time is spent doing the things that will move me in the direction of my goals.

Not constantly checking my phone.

Had an easier day yesterday in regards to work, woke up early and started to check my emails, strangely it’s a bit of a blur, I did code yesterday quite a bit. I went to see Family in the afternoon around 2-3 pm to help my sis start her cover letter, mum gave me some food as well. Ran into DaCruz in tesco and said hi it was nice to see her, went home did some more coding. Spoke to Habiba and spoke to Ish in the evening. For quite some time, and then got ready for bed.
