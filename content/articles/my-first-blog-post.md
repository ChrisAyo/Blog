  <p>Your current job, doesn’t fill you with the excitement it once did. You have become complacent, and it feels as though you are just going through the motions of doing the work. Lack of creativity and desire means it leaves you feeling empty, there is no end Goal or purpose insight. </p>

  <p>
  There is an opportunity for you to study a frontend course via Openclassroom. You grab it with two hands and apply, show so much enthusiasm, passion and excitement at the prospect of working in tech. You see it all the an office that’s vibrant and full of fun, collaborating with your colleagues, solving problems together and accomplishing a team goal. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  You picture yourself working remotely somewhere by the beach or in another city for a few months soaking in the good weather, the culture and expanding your comfort zone. 
  </p>
  So, the course starts and you are on top things, reading and doing the course material soaking up so much knowledge, we start with HTML, and work our way through to CSS. The high intensity of reading and doing the work lasted for about 2 weeks at most, after the excitement wore off and all that I was left with was my usual habits. The course was meant to take you 12 months to complete, as it was sponsored as well this should have been another incentive to get it done. It takes you over 18 months to complete might have even been 24 months. Several breaks in-between for personal reasons meant once you had a flow it was lost. Gathering a flow/ momentum was always a difficulty. 

  <p>
  You finish the course and it’s time to start the next journey, however you’re still fearful. You think about how much less you could potentially earn, you have work to do on your CV, you haven’t applied for Jobs. Fear of failure in the unconscious is crippling you. 
  </p>
