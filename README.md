## How to add a blog post
In order to add a blog post to the site, you will need to create a md. file in content, under the subfolder of articles. 

These are where all the posts are stored.

## Specific information
- About.Vue : This is a synopsis of me and a bit about the site/projects I am working on, also further links to my social media sites.

- Slug.vue : This is the template, for how my posts are styled and how it comes up. Being able to change fonts.

## Tech Stack

 Vue3, JS, Vuetify, HTML, CSS

## Usage/Examples

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts. 

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).


### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).
